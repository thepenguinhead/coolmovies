# Sprint Retrospective

Date/Time: 12/7/24  : 22:00

Participants: Jackson/Eldar/Gage/Jason/Sadeq

Communication was solid throughout each sprint. The biggest hurdle was establishing the database and learning how to populate it with data. In the future we would prioritize setting up a shared development environment ASAP before the end of the first sprint. Spent a lot of time towards the end of the last sprint addressing configuration errors with the deployment. 
Realized when writing instructions for deployment you have to adjust for different environments (Windows/Mac/Linux). 
Point estimation for user stories were fairly innacurate compared in retrospect. Would assign more points for admin control, favorites page, and the recommendation page.
