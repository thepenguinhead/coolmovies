All user stories implemented. Shrinking the dataset helped testing. Several team members found time to implement extra features like visual effects on the and admin features. 
In terms of development practices, need to improve testing practices, writing tests in consistent increments during the development process instead of towards the end. 
Learned a lot about API implementation.
Also pushed team members to learn SQL commands as it was needed to verify database contents.
