# Sprint Review

Date/Time: 12/03/24 - 16:00

Participants: Gage/Eldar/Jason/Jackson

- Holiday got in the way of goals but communication remained solid and progress was made. 
- Base functionality of the app is in place but database issues still need to be sorted out. Gage found a bug in the data import script and now the existing datasets are easier and more reliable to populate with. 
- Full dataset may be too large, should make plans to reduce or use another. 
- Trailer functionality still a possibility. 
- Search function is unreliable and makes it hard to find popular titles. Solution proposals should be brainstormed.
