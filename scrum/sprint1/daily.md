# Daily Scrums

# Daily scrums were completed via a Discord bot in our shared channel that schedules a meeting every day at 7PM/19:00. If a member cannot make meet that day, they post their status that day after the bot has posted. Daily scrums on Tuesday/Thursdays were held in after class when possible.
